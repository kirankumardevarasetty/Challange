Cloud KMS (Key Management Service) is a service offered by GCP that allows you to securely manage encryption keys. It provides a centralized repository for storing, generating, rotating, and using cryptographic keys.

Key Rings:

A key ring is a logical grouping of keys within Cloud KMS.
It acts as a container for organizing and managing related keys.
You can have multiple key rings within a project.
Key rings help with key management and access control.
Keys:

Keys are the actual cryptographic material used for encryption and decryption operations.
Cloud KMS supports symmetric and asymmetric keys.
You can create, import, and manage keys within key rings.
Keys can be used for various purposes like encrypting data at rest, protecting secrets, and signing data.
How Key Rings and Keys Work Together:

You create a key ring within your GCP project.
Within the key ring, you create and manage individual keys.
You can grant permissions on key rings and keys to control who can access and use them.
When you need to perform a cryptographic operation, you reference the specific key within the key ring.
Benefits of Using Cloud KMS:

Centralized Key Management: Store and manage keys in a secure and accessible location.
Enhanced Security: Protect keys with hardware security modules (HSMs) for added security.
Compliance: Meet compliance requirements by using Cloud KMS to manage encryption keys.
Integration: Easily integrate with other GCP services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery.
