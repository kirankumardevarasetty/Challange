L0 support, also known as self-service support, is the first level of technical support where users can find solutions to their problems without directly contacting support staff. It usually includes resources like:

Knowledge Bases: Articles, guides, and tutorials covering common issues and how to resolve them.
FAQs: Frequently asked questions with concise answers.
Community Forums: Where users can ask questions and get help from other users or moderators.
Chatbots: AI-powered tools that can provide instant responses to simple queries.
Troubleshooting Tools: Automated diagnostic tools that can identify and fix problems.
Benefits of L0 support for organizations:

Reduced Support Costs: By empowering users to resolve issues on their own, L0 support decreases the number of tickets that need to be handled by support agents, thus lowering staffing costs.
Improved Efficiency: Self-service options are available 24/7, allowing users to find solutions at their convenience, without having to wait for support staff availability.
Increased Customer Satisfaction: When users can quickly resolve issues without external help, it leads to a more positive experience and higher satisfaction levels.
Freed Up Support Resources: With fewer simple queries to handle, support agents can focus on more complex and critical issues that require their expertise.
Valuable Insights: L0 support interactions can provide valuable data on common issues, user behavior, and areas where documentation or products need improvement.
Overall, L0 support is a win-win for both organizations and users, as it offers a cost-effective, efficient, and convenient way to resolve technical problems.
